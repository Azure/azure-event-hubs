/**
 * This exception is thrown when a EventHubReceiver is being disconnected because of one of the
 * following reason:
 * <ul>
 * <li> user attempts to connect a non-epoch receiver to a event hub partition, when there is an epoch receiver connected to the partition.
 * <li> you are using an epoch receiver for a given partition but another epoch receiver with a higher epoch value connects to the same partition.
 * </ul>
 * User should make sure either all code are using non-epoch receivers, or ensure that there is only one epoch receiver processing a given partition 
 * at any given point in time.
