* put chai setup in a common fixture instead of duplicating it in every test file
* test that onErrorReceived function in EventHubReceiver constructor is only called once in response to an 'errorReceived' event
* file an issue in amqp10: AMQPError (and AMQPSymbol) should be promoted to the public interface since they are returned from public functions (like the 'errorReceived' event)
  --DONE: https://github.com/noodlefrenzy/node-amqp10/issues/192
* client#open/close tests don't really confirm that the connection is opened or closed...
* we're using azure-iot-common for ArgumentError and ConnectionString. Verify that we really want to take this dependency...
* receive test needs to filter events sent after Date.now(), rather than looking at *all* events in the hub, otherwise test will take longer over time
* split out integration tests from unit tests
* write a sample
