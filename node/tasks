* put chai setup in a common fixture instead of dupicating it in every test file
* expose EventHubClient as azure-eventhubs.Client
* test that onErrorReceived function in EventHubReceiver constructor is only called once in response to an 'errorReceived' event
* all integration tests should have a larger timeout (say, 15s?)--can I add a command line arg to 'npm run' scripts?
* grouping tests (and naming files) by scenario, doesn't help if tests themselves are still organized by class and method. Evaluate whether I should rename tests/suites, or rename files.
* in tests, should it be describe('.method', ...) instead of '#method' for static methods of a class? If so, be consistent...
* file an issue in amqp10: AMQPError (and AMQPSymbol) should be promoted to the public interface since they are returned from public functions (like the 'errorReceived' event)
* client#open/close tests don't really confirm that the connection is opened or closed...
