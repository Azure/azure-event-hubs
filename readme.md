#Microsoft Azure Event Hubs Clients

> Please note that the Java client has been moved to its own repository: (https://github.com/azure/azure-event-hubs-dotnet)

This repository contains two open-source, client-side libraries for Event Hubs written in [Node.js](./node) and [C (C99)](./c).

## Projects 
The clients in this repository are distinct projects and optimized for the respective language; they differ in terms of 
API shape and capabilities.   

Details about how to build and use the clients and how to explore and run the samples can be found in the respective READMEs

* The *Azure Event Hub Client for C* is currently in "preview" state, meaning that there is ongoing work to bring it 
  to a state where Microsoft can provide full product support. Learn more in the [README for the C client](./c/readme.md)
* The *Azure Event Hub Client for Node* is likewise in "preview" state. Learn more in the [README for the Node client](./node/README.md)
