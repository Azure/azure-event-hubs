# Role based access sample with Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs SDK

See [Authorize access to Event Hubs resources using Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/authorize-access-azure-active-directory) for information on Role based access (RBAC).

**Note**: This sample shows different ways to authenticate using Azure Active Directory with the legacy Event Hubs library `Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs`.
For the current version of the library `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs`, please see the [sample that makes use of credentials from Azure.Identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/samples/Sample06_IdentityAndSharedAccessCredentials.md).
