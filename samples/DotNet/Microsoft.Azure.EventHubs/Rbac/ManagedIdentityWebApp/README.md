# Managed Service Identity sample #

**Note:** This sample uses the legacy Event Hubs library `Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs`. We strongly encourage you to use the current library `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs`. See the  [corresponding sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs/tree/master/samples/DotNet/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/ManagedIdentityWebApp) that uses the current library.
