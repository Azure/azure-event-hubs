# Managed Service Identity sample #

**Note:** This sample uses the legacy Event Hubs library `Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs`. We strongly encourage you to use the new library `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs`. Here is the corresponding sample using the new library: [link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs/tree/master/samples/DotNet/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/ManagedIdentityWebApp). 

For more information on Managed Service Identity (MSI) and how to run this sample follow this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-managed-service-identity).
