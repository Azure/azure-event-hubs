# Using Kafka MirrorMaker with Event Hubs for Kafka Ecosystem

![MirrorMaker Diagram](./mirror-maker-graphic.PNG) 

One major consideration for modern cloud scale apps is being able to update, improve, and change infrastructure without interrupting service. In this tutorial, we show how a Kafka enabled Event Hub and Kafka MirrorMaker can integrate an existing Kafka pipeline into Azure by "mirroring" the Kafka input stream in the Event Hub service. 

An Azure Event Hubs Kafka endpoint enables users to connect to Azure Event Hubs using the Kafka protocol (i.e. Kafka clients). By making minimal changes to a Kafka application, users will be able to connect to Azure Event Hubs and reap the benefits of the Azure ecosystem. Kafka enabled Event Hubs currently supports Kafka versions 1.0 and later.

This example will show how to mirror a Kafka broker in a Kafka enabled Event Hub using Kafka MirrorMaker.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, make sure you have:

* An Azure subscription. If you do not have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
* [Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    * On Ubuntu, run `apt-get install default-jdk` to install the JDK.
    * Be sure to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the folder where the JDK is installed.
* [Download](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [install](http://maven.apache.org/install.html) a Maven binary archive
    * On Ubuntu, you can run `apt-get install maven` to install Maven.
* [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads)
    * On Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install git` to install Git.

## Create an Event Hubs namespace

An Event Hubs namespace is required to send or receive from any Event Hubs service. See [Create a Kafka enabled Event Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create-kafka-enabled) for instructions on getting an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint. Make sure to copy the Event Hubs connection string for later use.

## Clone the example project

Now that you have a Kafka enabled Event Hubs connection string, clone the Azure Event Hubs repository and navigate to the `mirror-maker` subfolder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs.git
cd azure-event-hubs/samples/kafka/mirror-maker
```

## Set up a Kafka cluster

Use the [Kafka quickstart guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) to set up a cluster with the desired settings (or use an existing Kafka cluster).

## Kafka MirrorMaker

Kafka MirrorMaker allows for the "mirroring" of a stream. Given source and destination Kafka clusters, MirrorMaker will ensure any messages sent to the source cluster will be received by both the source *and* destination clusters. In this example, we'll show how to mirror a source Kafka cluster with a destination Kafka enabled Event Hub. This scenario can be used to send data from an existing Kafka pipeline to Event Hubs without interrupting the flow of data. 

Check out the [Kafka Mirroring/MirrorMaker Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27846330) for more detailed information on Kafka MirrorMaker.

### Configuration

To configure Kafka MirrorMaker, we'll give it a Kafka cluster as its consumer/source and a Kafka enabled Event Hub as its producer/destination.

#### Consumer Configuration

Update the consumer configuration file `source-kafka.config`, which tells MirrorMaker the properties of the source Kafka cluster.

##### source-kafka.config

```config
bootstrap.servers={SOURCE.KAFKA.IP.ADDRESS1}:{SOURCE.KAFKA.PORT1},{SOURCE.KAFKA.IP.ADDRESS2}:{SOURCE.KAFKA.PORT2},etc	#Kafka endpoint
group.id=example-mirrormaker-group
exclude.internal.topics=true
client.id=mirror_maker_consumer
```

#### Producer Configuration

Now update the producer config file `mirror-eventhub.config`, which tells MirrorMaker to send the duplicated (or "mirrored") data to the Event Hubs service. Specifically change `bootstrap.servers` and `sasl.jaas.config` to point to your Event Hubs Kafka endpoint. The Event Hubs service requires secure (SASL) communication, which is achieved by setting the last three properties in the configuration below. 

##### mirror-eventhub.config

```config
bootstrap.servers={YOUR.EVENTHUBS.FQDN}:9093		#Event Hubs endpoint
client.id=mirror_maker_producer

#Required for Event Hubs
sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="$ConnectionString" password="{YOUR.EVENTHUBS.CONNECTION.STRING}";
```

### Run MirrorMaker

Run the Kafka MirrorMaker script from the root Kafka directory using the newly updated configuration files. Make sure to update the path of the config files (or copy them to the root Kafka directory) in the following command.

```bash
bin/kafka-mirror-maker.sh --consumer.config source-kafka.config --num.streams 1 --producer.config mirror-eventhub.config --whitelist=".*"
```

To verify that events are making it to the Kafka enabled Event Hub, check out the ingress statistics in the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/), or run a consumer against the Event Hub.

Now that MirrorMaker is running, any events sent to the source Kafka cluster should be received by both the Kafka cluster *and* the mirrored Kafka enabled Event Hub service. By using MirrorMaker and an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint, we can migrate an existing Kafka pipeline to the managed Azure Event Hubs service without changing the existing cluster or interrupting any ongoing data flow!
