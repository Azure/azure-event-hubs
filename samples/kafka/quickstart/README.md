# Send and Receive Messages using Azure Event Hubs for Apache Kafka Ecosystems

Azure Event Hubs is a highly scalable data streaming platform and event ingestion service, capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second. Event Hubs can process and store events, data, or telemetry produced by distributed software and devices. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.

An Event Hubs Kafka endpoint enables users to connect to Event Hubs using the Kafka protocol (i.e. Kafka clients). By making minimal changes to a Kafka application, users will be able to connect to Azure Event Hubs and reap the benefits of the Azure ecosystem. Kafka-enabled Event Hubs currently supports Kafka versions 1.0 and later.

This quickstart will show how to create and connect to an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint using an example producer and consumer.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

In addition:

* [Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    * On Ubuntu, run `apt-get install default-jdk` to install the JDK.
    * Be sure to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the folder where the JDK is installed.
* [Download](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [install](http://maven.apache.org/install.html) a Maven binary archive
    * On Ubuntu, you can run `apt-get install maven` to install Maven.
* [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads)
    * On Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install git` to install Git.

## Create an Event Hubs namespace

An Event Hubs namespace is required to send or receive from any Event Hubs service. See [Create Kafka-enabled Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create-kafka-enabled) for instructions on getting an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint. Make sure to copy the Event Hubs connection string for later use.

## Clone the example project

Now that you have a Kafka-enabled Event Hubs connection string, clone the Azure Event Hubs repository and navigate to the `quickstart` subfolder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs.git
cd azure-event-hubs/samples/kafka/quickstart
```

## Producer

Using the provided producer example, send messages to the Event Hubs service. To change the Kafka version, change the dependency in the pom file to the desired version.

### Provide an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint

#### producer.config

Update the `bootstrap.servers` and `sasl.jaas.config` values in `producer/src/main/resources/producer.config` to direct the producer to the Event Hubs Kafka endpoint with the correct authentication.

```config
bootstrap.servers={YOUR.EVENTHUBS.FQDN}:9093
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="$ConnectionString" password="{YOUR.EVENTHUBS.CONNECTION.STRING}";
```

### Run producer from command line

To run the producer from the command line, generate the JAR and then run from within Maven (alternatively, generate the JAR using Maven, then run in Java by adding the necessary Kafka JAR(s) to the classpath):

```bash
mvn clean package
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="TestProducer"
```

The producer will now begin sending events to the Kafka-enabled Event Hub at topic `test` and printing the events to stdout. If you would like to change the topic, change the TOPIC constant in `producer/src/main/java/com/example/app/TestProducer.java`.

## Consumer

Using the provided consumer example, receive messages from the Kafka-enabled Event Hubs. To change the Kafka version, change the dependency in the pom file to the desired version.

### Provide an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint

#### consumer.config

Change the `bootstrap.servers` and `sasl.jaas.config` values in `consumer/src/main/resources/consumer.config` to direct the consumer to the Event Hubs endpoint with the correct authentication.

```config
bootstrap.servers={YOUR.EVENTHUBS.FQDN}:9093
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="$ConnectionString" password="{YOUR.EVENTHUBS.CONNECTION.STRING}";
```

### Run consumer from command line

To run the producer from the command line, generate the JAR and then run from within Maven (alternatively, generate the JAR using Maven, then run in Java by adding the necessary Kafka JAR(s) to the classpath):

```bash
mvn clean package
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="TestConsumer"
```

If the Kafka-enabled Event Hub has queued events (for instance, if your producer is also running), then the consumer should now begin receiving events from topic `test`. If you would like to change the topic, change the TOPIC constant in `producer/src/main/java/com/example/app/TestConsumer.java`.
